# Java_Ecom 
1. Login - Existing User and Admin
2. Register - New User
3. Home - User
    * View Categories - based on category
    * View Products - Add products to cart.
    * View Cart - Check out products from cart.

# Created Files :
 
1. credential file for storing user data.
2. Product file for storing Products.
  
# Steps:
1. Used MVC (Model, View, Controller) architecture for developing the console application.
2. Added the required Models, Views , utils and Controller along with Interface implementation to achieve abstraction.
3. Used encapsulation to hide data and used getter and setter for getting and setting the data for the models.
4. Used "ArrayList" to store and manipulate data according to the user preferrences.
5. Used "CSV" Files for handling data.
 
# Challenges:
1. Faced many exception like inputException,nullException etc..
2. Problem in addTocart and it shows nullexception.
3. Trying to set cart file dynamically .
4. And I made so many logical mistakes .

# Yet to work:
1. Admin side
   - view Category
   - Edit category
   - Add product
   - delete product
   - edit product
